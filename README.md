## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
After performing a multiple linear regression on the MechaCars_mpg.csv dataset, the following conclusions can be made:  
- **Vehicle Length** and **Ground Clearance** are statistically significant. These variables provide a non-random amount of variance to the MPG values in the dataset.
- The high significance level of the intercept implies that there are other factors that are significant to MPG. Since all available variables in this dataset were already passed in this regression, it can be inferred that additional research and data are necessary to uncover these unknown significant variables.
